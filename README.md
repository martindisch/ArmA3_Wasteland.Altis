# Will of Fire A3Wasteland Altis

A3Wasteland is a survival-like combat sandbox, which incorporates elements of team deathmatch and sector control in one big fun-to-play package. Similar to DayZ, the objectives are to scavenge weapons and vehicles, team up with fellow players, and engage in combat to obtain control of the landscape. Best experienced with 50 or more players. 

Will of Fire ([Hi no Ishi](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Will_of_Fire) -> HNI) A3Wasteland is a modification of A3Wasteland. The main difference is the placement of stores and territories, which should make for more interesting gameplay. The layout is based on EEM Wasteland, which is sadly no longer available. Another change is the reintroduction of the vanilla rearm system. There are still resupply trucks next to vehicle stores where you can pay to resupply, but any ammo trucks you buy and hide somewhere let you rearm at no charge. Besides this, many other small things have been changed, such as the reward amount for missions, payout for holding territories and more.

The source code is based on vanilla [A3Wasteland](https://github.com/A3Wasteland/ArmA3_Wasteland.Altis), which is based on [GoT Wasteland](https://github.com/JoSchaap/GoT_Wasteland_V2.Stratis), which is based on [404 Wasteland](https://github.com/domuk/Arma3-404Wasteland-Stratis), which is based on [Sa-Matra's Wasteland](http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?142427), which is ultimately based on [Tonic's Wasteland](http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?140070).
